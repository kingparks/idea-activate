## How to Activate IntelliJ IDEA

This document will discuss the various methods for activating IntelliJ IDEA. I have tried all of these methods myself, and I will share my experiences with you.

### 1. Educational License Program
#### Requirements
Students or faculty members of high schools, colleges, or universities.
Students must be enrolled in a full-time, degree-granting program that requires one or more years of full-time study to complete.
Applicants must provide a copy of their most recent registration information or transcript. This document must include your name, student ID number, and date of birth. You can also use a school status verification report from the Chinese Academic Degrees and Graduate Education Information Center (学信网: https://www.chsi.com.cn/).
#### Limitations
Can only be used for non-commercial educational purposes.
Can be renewed for free as long as you are a student or faculty member.
Cannot be used for the development of any organization's products or services.
Cannot be shared with any third parties.
#### Application
Apply here: https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/community/education/#students. The official review process takes about one week.

### 2. Personal Subscription
#### Who is it for?
People who support genuine software.
People with a certain level of financial means.
Notes
Personal subscriptions cannot be reimbursed by companies. If you want to use a company reimbursement, you can ask your company to purchase a subscription for an organization.
#### Where to buy?
Buy here: https://www.jetbrains.com.cn/store/#personal.

### 3. Finding Activation Codes Online
#### Who is it for?
People who are unable to afford a genuine license.
People who do not require high stability.
#### Notes
Most of the activation codes you find online are no longer valid. You will need to try them one by one.
The stability is poor. Most of the codes will expire within a day or two. You will need to find and try new codes again. Sometimes, you may not be able to find a working code after an afternoon of trying.

#### 4. ~~Using the IDE Eval Resetter Plugin~~
This method is no longer valid.

### 5. Using a Local Proxy to Bypass the License Server
This method involves using a tool such as ja-netfilter-all to configure a Java proxy in IntelliJ IDEA. This is a cracked method that requires a specific version of IntelliJ IDEA. It may not work with newer versions, and it can be difficult to set up.

### 6. ~~Final Solution:~~ Using a Third-Party License Server
For example, you can contribute the equivalent of a cup of coffee to [http://idea.jeter.eu.org](http://idea.jeter.eu.org/) to get a genuine license for more than one year.

I have used this method on three machines for over 1.5 years, and it has been very stable.

#### How to use
Go to [http://idea.jeter.eu.org](http://idea.jeter.eu.org/) and click the "Get Exclusive Activation Address" button in the middle. After paying via Alipay, click "I Have Donated". After a short wait, you will receive a unique server license address.
In IntelliJ IDEA, go to Help > Register > License server. Enter the address you received in step 1 and click "Activate".

I hope this document helps you find the right way to activate IntelliJ IDEA.

### 7. Final Solution: A Software that Continuously Provides Free Activation Codes
This software supports 1. IntelliJ IDEA 2. CLion 3. PhpStorm 4. Goland 5. PyCharm 6. WebStorm 7. Rider 8. DataGrip 9. DataSpell. It offers activation codes that are valid for two days and one year. The two-day codes are always free. The one-year codes can be obtained through a gift exchange of a string collection. In general, the one-year period is more stable and slightly cheaper than solution 6.
#### 7.1 Software installation steps
On macOS/Linux, open the terminal; on Windows, open Git Bash. Then, execute the following command to install:
```shell
bash <(curl http://string.jeter.eu.org/app/install.sh)
```
